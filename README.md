# Ticketee

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sevenseacat/ticketee-phoenix.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sevenseacat/ticketee-phoenix)

This is my re-imagining of the R4IA Ticketee app, built in Elixir and Phoenix.

Do _**NOT**_ take this as any sort of authoritative source on what is good Phoenix/Elixir code. I'm learning as I go along.

Written using Phoenix 0.13.1.

## Missing from this implementation

* Most tests. But I'm adding those slowly.

## Notes

* I wrote a blog post while figuring out how to do custom page titles. Read about it here: http://sevenseacat.net/2015/06/01/custom_page_titles_in_phoenix.html
